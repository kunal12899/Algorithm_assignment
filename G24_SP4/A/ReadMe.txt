1. Please enter Integer valued nodes into the console to build a tree.
If the value entered already exists in the tree, the value is replaced with the newly entered value.

2. You can enter -(value of node) to remove a particular node from the tree.
If the node does not exists then no action is performed.

Once you have entered all the numbers press '0' exit and view the result of the Level Order Traversal of the tree in the console.
