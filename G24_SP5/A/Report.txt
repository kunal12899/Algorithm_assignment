Part A:

//Please note, number of permutations are not given in report, but we have printed the total number of permutations.

For Perumatation :


When n=1,2,3......9; after multiple run i got same timing for both algorithm, but in various run  sometime take2 took less time than take3 and visa versa.

(below result for n=9)
Permutation of numbers Using Take2::
Time taken : 16 ms
Total number of permutation 362880
Permutation of numbers Using Take3/Heap Alogrithm::
Time taken : 16 ms
Total number of permutation 362880


when n=10, then Heap Algorithm took less time

Permutation of numbers Using Take2::
Time taken : 343 ms
Total number of permutation 3628800
Permutation of numbers Using Take3/Heap Algorithm::
Time taken : 219 ms
Total number of permutation 3628800


when n=11, then Heap Algorithm took more time.
Permutation of numbers Using Take2::
Time taken : 1531 ms
Total number of permutation 39916800
Permutation of numbers Using Take3/Heap Alogrithm::
Time taken : 2063 ms
Total number of permutation 39916800


when n=12, then  Heap Alogrithm took more time. and time taken by both algorithm increased more

Permutation of numbers Using Take2::
Time taken : 18499 ms
Total number of permutation 479001600
Permutation of numbers Using Take3/Heap Algorithm::
Time taken : 25907 ms
Total number of permutation 479001600

for n=13 and more it is taking too much time, so I stopped .
