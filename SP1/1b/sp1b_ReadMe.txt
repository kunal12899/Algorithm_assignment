Please enter the base of the numbers in the list for the program to compute the addition and subtraction of given numbers.

Since the code requires different base of numbers as the input, I have intentionally left some commented input statements in the main function, for sample input for base 10, base 2 and base 8. These inputs can be modified and tested directly.
