MergeSort on LinkedList

MErge sort is applied on Java's link implementation LinkedList.
Code does not demand any input it takes self generated random integers for this process.
At max one can change amount of input data from program. 
so input is hardcoded.

code can be compiled in usual way.

Observation : MergeSort happens to be slow on linkedlist as compared to arrays.
